TPSite uses Node, Express, JADE, mongoDB, node-mail and more.
Still Waiting for images and more from UX.
The main backend file is routes/index.js where I bring the data from the mongoDB into the JADE templates (views/main.jade). As well I connect the pages forms into nodemailer and mongoDB. The main functionality file is in public/js/script.js.

This site is fully html5/css3 responsive using both bootstrap and custom mediaqueries in my css.
I still need a few handheld testing devices to dialin the mediaqueries (emulators only get so far).
The site is set up with scrolling navigation (hit links in top menu) which is part of design specs...

nodeSite is another MEAN stack site with similar node dependancies as above. Also awaiting images and content.

the other directories contain html/css and javascript for different intranetsfor clints. The html is basicly placeholder code which has been replaced by data fed loops in the production applications.
