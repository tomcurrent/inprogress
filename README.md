InProgress TahoePartners:
The three directories here all contain work that is in progress and are either awaiting images or clients to set up dbs.

/* ----------------------- */

nodeTahoe:

This is a node.js site using Express, JADE and mongoDB.
Still Waiting for images. This template will be used for both this site and a new homePage currently in design phase.
The main backend file is routes/index.js where I bring the data from the mongoDB into the JADE templates (views/main.jade). The main functionality file is in public/js/script.js.
As well I connect the pages forms into nodemailer and mongoDB.
This site is fully html5/css3 responsive using both bootstrap and custom mediaqueries in my css.
I still need a few handheld testing devices to dialin the mediaqueries (emulators only get so far).
The site is set up with scrolling navigation (hit links in top menu) whioch is part of design specs...

jazzPharma: 

These are layouts and functionality to be integrated into their SharePoint intranet.
Waiting for then so set up their DB so as to connect the data to the layouts.
The CSS is all namespaced with [data-tp] so as to resolve conflicts with SharePoint's touchy css.
As well, still need them to figureout their video libs so as to hook up the right hand menu to new videos...
I have written a custom slider (tpSlider.js) for this app.
Below are my DEV URLs to both pages:

menuRayes:

These are custom menus to be added to their SharePoint Intranets.
Waiting for them to give me asset URL,s to map into my model.
The CSS is all namespaced with #globalmenu so as to resolve conflicts with SharePoint's touchy css.
Below is the dev URL (click icons in top of page):
