nodeSite:

This is a node.js site using Express, JADE and mongoDB.
Still Waiting for images and more.
The main backend file is routes/index.js where I bring the data from the mongoDB into the JADE templates (views/main.jade). As well I connect the pages forms into nodemailer and mongoDB. The main functionality file is in public/js/script.js.

This site is fully html5/css3 responsive using both bootstrap and custom mediaqueries in my css.
I still need a few handheld testing devices to dialin the mediaqueries (emulators only get so far).
The site is set up with scrolling navigation (hit links in top menu) which is part of design specs...

layouts: 

These are layouts and functionality to be integrated into a SharePoint intranet.
Waiting for then so set up their DB so as to connect the data to the layouts.
The CSS is all namespaced with [data-tp] so as to resolve conflicts with SharePoint's touchy css.
As well, still need them to figureout their video libs so as to hook up the right hand menu to new videos...
I have written a custom slider (tpSlider.js) for this app.
Below are my DEV URLs to both pages:

menus:

These are custom menus to be added to a SharePoint Intranet.
Waiting for them to give me asset URL,s to map into my model.
The CSS is all namespaced with #globalmenu so as to resolve conflicts with SharePoint's touchy css.
Below is the dev URL (click icons in top of page):
